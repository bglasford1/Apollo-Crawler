# Apollo-Crawler

I have started building a model of the Saturn V rocket, the Launcher-Umbilical Tower (LUT) and the Crawler that transports the rocket and LUT from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad.  I am starting with the Crawler.  The build progress and logs can be found on the Hackaday website at https://hackaday.io/project/186955-apollo-crawler.  This project houses the 3D print files and other various files.  There is a main spreadsheet that I am using to track my progress.

The model is based on a 1:70 scale model by smc321 on thingverse at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4563734.  There is not much detail for a model this size so I am modifying this starting point to add more detail and create a more accurate model.  I like that this person boxed in the interior space in styrene as I also chose not to model the interior of this space. I will add files as I print and verify them.
